# RSE training for CIFAR10

This is the code used to do RSE training and testing. Intially this has been done my manually chaning the model structure, this can be found in resnet_RSE.py

Following this an implementation to convert any pytorch model to RSE was created, this can be found in https://github.com/Tobiasbrambo/pytorch_rse The precursor to this is found in convert_to_RSE.py in this directory.
