# Robust AI

This is the code for my project in IKT463 - AI in society, where I've compared multiple methods for improving adversarial robustness.

The project has focused on comparing Adversarial training and different ensemble techniques on white-box attacks. Further the implementation of feature squeezing has been done.

### Repository Structure
- RSE_resnet18/: Contains implementations and experiments related to the ResNet-18 architecture with Random Self-Ensemble (RSE) techniques.
- pytorch-cifar/: Includes PyTorch implementations for experimentation done on the other methods.
