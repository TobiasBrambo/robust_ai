### TODO:
- [ ] TRACK TRAINING TIME ETC. FOR ALL EXPERIMENTS. FOR PLOTS
- [ ] Find best CNN setup to best match the different experiments
- [ ] Setup nice experiment pipeline (?)
- [ ] Implement different training schemes
- [ ] Implement different experiments, to test different training schemes



potential setup:

final table:
- train each model using each method
- test on a set of attacks, regardless of which have been used during training.
    - FGSM
    - ...
- test all on attack method for any of the models
    - ...

- for ensamble methods, could get the accuracies for multiple different combinations of models
