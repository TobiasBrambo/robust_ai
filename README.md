# Robust AI

This is the code for my project in IKT463 - AI in society, where I've compared multiple methods for improving adversarial robustness.

The code used for RSE can be found in RSE_resnet18, the rest in the pytorch-cifar directory.



### Repository Structure
- RSE_resnet18/: Contains implementations and experiments related to the ResNet-18 architecture with Random Self-Ensemble (RSE) techniques.
- pytorch-cifar/: Includes PyTorch implementations for CIFAR dataset experiments.
